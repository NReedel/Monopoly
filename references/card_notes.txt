Each card has a common theme (within their Community Chest and Chance designations) for which there is a common picture as follows:
(format is "'image-description': 'card-theme' \n\t '- card-text'" except in the case of subgroups of Chance movement cards, in which the cards are subdivided by movement type.)

Chance:
(9) Running: in meta terms, always moving positions on the board with overall neutral financial consequences. See subgroups below
	(1) Advance to the nearest Utility. Collect $200 if pass GO, but, if owned, pay 10 times your dice roll (the card does not mention whether the owner must own both utilities for this task, meaning the player must pay 10 times regardless of number of utilities owned)
		- “ADVANCE TO THE NEAREST UTILITY. If UNOWNED, you may buy it from the Bank. If OWNED, roll the dice, and pay the owner 10 times your roll. IF YOU PASS GO, COLLECT $200.”
	(2) Two identical cards: Advance to the next Railroad. Collect $200 if pass GO, but, if owned, pay twice the normal rent than the owner is originally entitled (if own more than one railroad, the same stacking rent applies, e.g. 2 railroads with a rent of $50 becomes a rent of $100 with this card.)
		- “ADVANCE TO THE NEXT RAILROAD. If UNOWNED, you may buy it from the Bank. If OWNED, pay the owner twice the rent to which they are otherwise entitled. IF YOU PASS GO, COLLECT $200.”
	(1) Advance to [Railroad @ index 5 (Reading Railroad in USA ed)]. No special rent rules apply.
		- “TAKE A TRIP TO READING RAILROAD. IF YOU PASS GO, COLLECT $200.”
	(3) Advance to (specific location) with subgroups below:
		- “ADVANCE TO [tile @ index 24 (Illinois Avenue in USA ed)]. IF YOU PASS GO, COLLECT $200.
		- “ADVANCE TO [tile @ index 11 (St. Charles Place in USA ed)]. IF YOU PASS GO, COLLECT $200.
		- “ADVANCE TO [tile @ index 39 (Boardwalk in USA ed)].” Due to index location, this card does not declare to collect $200 if pass GO, since no situation should arise in which the character passes GO by advancing here.
	(1) ADVANCE TO GO. COLLECT $200.

(2) Thumbs Up: financial benefits (collect)
